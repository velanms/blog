Lately I've been noticing that my online presence has been all over the place. I usually keep my online presence organized by using a password manager and making sure I make a note of the online services that I'm a part of. Despite all that, I've been greeted with a lot of unsolicited emails, whichâ€”in all honesty, I'm tired of at this point.

So I've decided that I would declutter my online presence and organize my online self. It would require a lot of going back and forth. And my hope is eventually this exercise would make me more productive and help me use my tools better.

Good day :)
