For some reason that I don't remember, I had ditched Fastmail for a self-hosted email setup. Which, then I realized, was a bad idea since self-hosting email is too anxiety inducing; at least if you don't know what you're doing. In my case, it was since I had no clue how the parts moved inside the self-hosted mail service. I just did it for the fun of it and maybe to learn a thing or two in the process. 

## Enter: [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/)

I have then moved to outsourcing my anxiety to a managed mail clients. I tried mailbox.org for their cheapest plan (3 EUR / month) that covers custom domains. Ability to add custom domains are a requirement since I plan on running the services for [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) on my server and I should be able to send mails across using SMTP.

Mailbox is great for what it does. It's cheap, it's fast and it works. However, the UI/UX is not for me. The payment process is clunky where you add credits instead of direct payment from credit card. And the web interface is not so intuitive and user-friendly. And then I thought it's time to move to a new email service.

## Fastmail.com â€“ Again!

So I hopped back to [fastmail.com](https://fastmail.com) and right off the bat, this sweet nostalgia of UI/UX hit me in the face. I took their trial and then started adding custom domains to the mail client. In 5 mins, I was done. The same task took me almost an hour with mailbox with the SPF and DKIM keys. Boy, I had missed Fastmail. And I don't think I'll go back to any other email services anytime soon. 

Good day :)
