      <title>Maybe, The Technology Evolved Too Fast</title>

      <description>In this post I speak about my thoughts about the current state of technology and what I miss about the (perceived) old times.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, my mum and I were going through the old photo albums and archive of old times that were stashed in the cupboard. My mum held onto a piece of paper that was unnaturally torn and withered in nature. However, she held onto it as if it was very valuable to her, and it brought a smile to her face. And of course it was. It was a letter written by my dad while he was away for work.</p>
<p>Back in 1997-98, when I was a small boy, my dad used to stay far away from us for work. He has been away working for years. Yet, he sent so many letters which would take months to reach home. Even though those letters are so many years old, they still hold so much value to my mum. That made me wonder, why doesn’t that happen to us when we send messages across? If technology was supposed to bring people together, why doesn’t it evoke the same feelings as those not-so-techy letters?</p>
<p>So I started to think deeply about it and decided that I would write about the things I brainstorm. Guess it&rsquo;s going to be a long explainer. So brace yourself :)</p>
<h2 id="correlation-between-efforts-and-value">Correlation between efforts and value</h2>
<p>Naturally, any tangible or intangible asset gains value when the reproducibility of it is difficult or expensive. For example, Gold has value because there is only a finite amount of it in this world and the reproducibility of this asset is extremely expensive. You can apply this logic to anything, and it would still fit.</p>
<p>Applying the same logic to the letters, it turns out that writing a letter is a time intensive process. The farther the person is, the more time it would take in the delivery of the letter. So, you would also have to compensate for that buffer time in advance. All in all, there is a significant amount of time and brain work involved in writing/posting the letters. And that buffer and efforts involved, give those letters a certain value. When you are the recipient, you know that the person who wrote it, has put a significant amount of efforts into them and that makes them valuable because they are not as easy to reproduce.</p>
<p>The intermediaries of communication, (in this case the letters) play a significant role in deciding how our human to human relationships are cherished and experienced. In other words, the intermediaries of communication IRL influence human relationships.</p>
<h2 id="fast-forward-two-decades">Fast-forward two decades</h2>
<p>It’s 2022 and the technology has engulfed the entire world. Why write letters when you can type something and send it to any corner of the world in just a matter of seconds! You don’t have to put efforts into writing the letter, writing the address, posting it. All this long and effort-invoving tasks are a thing of the past now.</p>
<p>However, just think for a moment.</p>
<p>Did we actually lose that special feeling that the intermediaries of communications provide when we evolved to use better technology with time? In my opinion, we sure have.</p>
<p>Was it really worth it? I’m not really sure.</p>
<p>Is there a better way? There should be. That’s what we humans are good at. We figure out a way to solve the problem better than any other organism in this entire world. (Unless you are a bot who is reading this)</p>
<p>But I think now we are locked-in with this trend, and it’s going to be very hard to change or refine (if it requires change or refinement) this system since the entirety of the population is dependent on it.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m not criticizing the evolution of technology here. I know the evolution is perpetual, and technological evolution seems like an obvious way to move forward. However, we might have collectively chosen a path forward too quickly.</p>
<p>I’m by no means an expert in this field. If my take on this topic is blunt, consider me irrelevant. But I really do miss the special feeling of writing those letters. I have written letters before, and I still have the letters that I have received from my loved one’s. But I haven’t had the impulse to store the messages, just like I have done with letters. They don’t make me feel as special as letters do. That makes me suspect that we evolved too quickly with technology and these constructs of modern messaging and communication are locked in with our day-to-day life.</p>
<p>We sure are losing a special touch of human to human communications with the new constructs, and there should be a better way of building these blocks of communications. The one’s that actually makes you feel special the way letters do. I’m not sure if it’s possible sometime in the future, or if my take on this topic is blatant or nonsensical. But as a technophile / technologist, all I can do is hope for a better future.</p>
<p>Have a good day :)</p>

      <title>Ecosystematic Walls of Incarceration </title>
      <link>https://velanms.com/posts/ecosystem-incarceration/</link>

      <description>Just a little motivation for you to get out of that ecosystem</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Leave this ecosystem? No way! Why should I leave it when they are providing everything for free and it&rsquo;s so convenient when everything is just there when you want it!&rdquo; Yep! This is me approximately one year ago when I was heavily tied into the Google Ecosystem and I had been totally involved in all aspects inside this Ecosystem for five to six years straight. And it took me couple of months to actually explore the internet and discover why it was a bad idea. It&rsquo;s very easy to say that any service on the internet is convenient because it makes your life so easier. However, every convenience comes with a cost. In here, your freedom of choice and your privacy is at stake!</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find the idea of moving out of my ecosystem was considerable because my Ecosystem  seemed like my &lsquo;Eden Garden&rsquo; where everything I wanted to do was in my hand&rsquo;s reach. Want to store and retrieve photos easily? Use Google Photos. Want to store your documents? Use Google Drive. Want to edit those documents? Use Google docs. Want to add your photos to those documents? Google photos is integrated with Google docs. It&rsquo;s as if the your Ecosystem knows what you want to do even before you even think of doing it. This nature of an Ecosystem poses us with two big problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy :</strong> Your Ecosystem knows a lot about you already to understand what you would possibly want to do (Only if it&rsquo;s collecting your data which is  what most of the ecosystems do).</li>
<li><strong>Restriction :</strong> Your Ecosystem confines you inside its walls restricting you from even thinking about migrating from your services because if you do, you may have to give up some of that convenience. And it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot of time to unhook the hooks the ecosystem puts on you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Privacy in an Ecosystem is a bigger discussion in itself. I want to specifically talk about the second one where it confines you inside its walls, which had happened to me. Convenience is like a drug (to put it bluntly). And even if I had known that my ecosystem tracks me 24/7, I was reluctant to give away my convenience. When you are heavily tied into an Ecosystem, you stop looking for other services which are clearly better because whatever your Ecosystem provides is the one that would work best for you in the current state and even if it&rsquo;s something crappy and something you didn&rsquo;t like, you would have to live with it. This is how the Ecosystem suppresses your freedom of choice by making you enslaved for what you are being provided, not for what you have demanded. That is basically monopolistic nature put into digital media.</p>
<h2 id="the-realization">The Realization</h2>
<p>Last year, I chose to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Record_(autobiography)">&lsquo;Permanent record&rsquo; by Edward Snowden</a>. It really changed my outlook and it made me question my online presence. It was really implicative when I looked back at my &ldquo;Ecosystematical&rdquo; lifestyle and how much I was missing out on the true essence of what makes the internet special. And, I decided I would migrate my data to those services that are clearly better and explore the wide world out there. And the journey was painfully slow because I had an archive of 50+ GB&rsquo;s of photos in Google Photos and most of my documents were backed up in Google Drive.</p>
<h4 id="the-takeout-process">The Takeout Process</h4>
<p>Google has a takeout program where you can select all of your data and then request for a copy. Google then aggregates your data and then compresses them down to a zip file. You&rsquo;ll get an email in your gmail inbox. Then you can download your data through the link. Easy right? No!!</p>
<p>What Google does, is it lets you choose how big of a data chunk you want to download. Say you have an archive of 20GB, you can download it in two chunks of 10GB each or 10 chunks of 2GB each. And those downloads will fail if your internet connection drops down certain threshold. Then you need to retry. If it fails more than 3 times, you need to request for the data again. Most of the people would give up here and choose to spend some more time in this ecosystem until they try again and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>I had to request for my data thrice and I still couldn&rsquo;t download all my data. And the only inconvinient process around the whole ecosystem was the takeout process. I don&rsquo;t know if it was done deliberately, but I had to let go of my 50GB+ of archive which had very important documents and photos. My <em>Eden Garden</em> was punishing me when I decided to move away from it.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>The solution is to move towards open source projects or towards the services that focus on your privacy. When any service focuses on your privacy, it just means they value you as an end user. Internet means Freedom. So, you should be the one who own your free will to navigate around and call yourself at home. It sure takes a lot of trial and errors to make yourself comfortable by finding a balance between convenicence and digital privacy. But it&rsquo;s gonna be worth it. The more private you go, less convinient your experience will be. However, there are so many alternatives on the world wide web which is enough for you to build your own convenient ecosystem.</p>
<p>You might want to look at <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud Project</a> which is a self hosted cloud solution which has plugins for any use case that you might have.</p>
<p>If you want to start self hosting cheap and best, you might want to look at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Project</a> which is a credit card sized computer which can be used to host your self hosted setup which can be scaled further in future. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>So, Instead of living in someone else&rsquo;s Eden Garden where you live in their terms, why don&rsquo;t you make your own Garden and live by your terms. Isn&rsquo;t that what freedom tastes like?</p>
